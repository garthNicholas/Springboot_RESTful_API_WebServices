Spring Boot CRUD REST API with MySQL Database -  Employee Management System


In this project I learnt to build REST API's using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate) and MySQL for an Employee Management Project


During the build I had to create the following:
 - Building RESTful webservices using Spring Boot 

- Developing 3 Layer architecture (Controller, Service and Repository) in Spring boot application 

- Connecting Spring boot application to MySQL database 

- Using Lombok library to reduce boilerplate code  

- Using Spring Data JPA in Spring boot application
